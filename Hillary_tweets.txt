To truly honor those lost at Benghazi, we need to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the brave Americans who do their work.

America must do all we can to protect our personnel doing the important work of representing our interests and values around the world.

The work of Chris Stevens and his colleagues represented the best of this approach to foreign policy.

America must pursue a smart brand of leadership that integrates and balances the tools of diplomacy, development, and defense.

We cannot return to the go-it-alone foreign policy of the past, where military-based solutions are pursued as a first option.

American diplomats cannot conduct their work from bunkers. Advancing US interests often means going to unstable regions.

Hillary is testifying before @HouseBenghazi to defend the vision of US diplomacy that Ambassador Stevens gave his life carrying out.

America must continue to lead in a dangerous world. To do otherwise would mean drawing the wrong lesson from the Benghazi tragedy.

A lesson from Benghazi: Congress needs to do its part to ensure that our diplomats in dangerous parts of the world are as safe as possible.

Politics are hard. But when it comes to gun violence, we cannot give up. We cannot sit by while more good people die. We must keep going.

It makes no sense that bipartisan legislation supporting universal background checks failed despite overwhelming support from the public.

A majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners support universal background checks.

We need commonsense reforms to keep weapons out of the hands of criminals, the violently unstable, domestic abusers, and terrorists.

We lose people to gun violence every day. It‚Äôs time to come to grips with this.

Not one of the 17 GOP candidates has discussed how they'd address the rising cost of college. Disappointing, but not surprising.

We need to help students who are also parents. When you help parents get an education, you're also helping their children.

Today on the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Adam, Dale &amp; I are thrilled to spend the day with Hillary. ADA25

We know Hillary‚Äôs a fighter &amp; that she‚Äôll fight for Adam as President just like she did at the Children‚Äôs Defense Fund &amp; in Congress.

Iowa's @SenatorHarkin co-authored the ADA. We're proud to have been represented by such a strong champion for people with disabilities.

Later that night, she joined us to talk about the big questions that really need to be asked‚Äîfor Adam, and for everyone fighting for a cure.

"What do we have here?" she asked. Adam's father came over, thanking Hillary for her commitment to epilepsy research with a hug.

I‚Äôll never forget the first time Adam met Hillary. At a dinner in 2007, Adam broke away from us &amp; ran up to her.

Adam's teacher said, "We‚Äôll make it happen‚Äîthat's our job." The rest is history. He has loved, loved it.

She told me that he was a great runner! I just thought, "How would this happen?" I knew it should happen, but I also knew the challenges.

We‚Äôre grateful for supportive teachers. In junior high, his PE teacher called &amp; asked if Adam would go for cross country.

For Adam, that means enjoying cross country. At meets, other teams run him in &amp; congratulate him. It's neat to see! http://t.co/YGk4krihuz

Through Adam, we informally raise awareness for people with disabilities every day: It's as simple as taking pride in the small things.

We‚Äôll rely on organizations in our community, because Adam will need training, direction &amp; safety as an adult.

One thing that concerns us as Adam gets older is what happens after he finishes school.

The ADA ensures Adam &amp; Turbo are welcome everywhere. Turbo even joined us at Wrigley Field for a @Cubs game! http://t.co/msnZm7FcRg

Adam‚Äôs service dog Turbo is a huge part of our lives. He goes everywhere with Adam, including school.

He‚Äôs always doing that. http://t.co/dQKmLOtkCw

During the school year, Adam's a member of the cross country team. I never imagined he'd be a runner like me &amp; Dale, but he proved us wrong.

His father Dale &amp; I work, so Adam spends summer days at @TheArcUS. Yesterday we celebrated ADA Night at @CRKernels! http://t.co/n8ysuMoseC

"The defining economic challenge of our time is clear: We must raise wages for hard-working Americans."

Let's build an economy that works for everyone. Join Hillary: http://t.co/nW2JqXGZT9 http://t.co/qDSTlIljsJ

"I‚Äôm running for President to build an America for tomorrow, not yesterday‚Äîwhere if you do your part, you will reap the rewards."‚ÄîHillary

"Above all, we have to break out of the poisonous partisan gridlock and focus on the long-term needs of our country."

"Let's get back to making decisions that rely on evidence more than ideology."

"I will appoint and empower regulators who understand that Too Big To Fail is still too big a problem."

"I will offer plans to rein in excessive risk on Wall Street and ensure that stock markets work for everyday investors."

"Too often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences...This is wrong‚Äî&amp; on my watch, it will change."

Hillary on misconduct in the financial industry: "There can be no justification or tolerance for this kind of criminal behavior."

"Workers are assets. Investing in them pays off. Higher wages pay off. And training pays off."

"Too many pressures in our economy today are pushing us toward short-termism." http://t.co/AgJQAOjBB9

"The third key driver of income gains alongside strong growth and fair growth must be long-term growth." http://t.co/3wz5pKFic7

"When all Americans have the chance to study hard, work hard, and share in our country‚Äôs prosperity‚Äîthat‚Äôs fair growth."

"To create fair growth, we need to create opportunity for more Americans." http://t.co/zt177GbuwG

"If we want to get serious about raising incomes, we have to get serious about supporting union workers."

"I will propose ways to encourage companies to share profits with their employees. That's good for workers, and good for businesses."

"To get all incomes rising again, we need to strike a better balance. If you work hard, you ought to be paid fairly."

"Let him tell that to the fast food workers marching in the streets for better pay.

They don‚Äôt need a lecture‚Äîthey need a raise."

"You may have heard Gov. Bush say last week that Americans just need to work longer hours. He must not have met very many American workers."

"The evidence is in: Inequality is a drag on our entire economy. This is the problem we need to tackle." http://t.co/Q6Bbhwbtb6

"As President, I‚Äôll fight to put families first‚Äîjust like I have my entire career."

"For far too long, these challenges have been dismissed by some as 'women‚Äôs issues.' Well, those days are over."

"It‚Äôs way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job‚Äîand women of color making even less."

"It‚Äôs time to recognize that quality, affordable child care is not a luxury‚Äîit‚Äôs a growth strategy."

"When we leave people out, or write them off, we not only shortchange them‚Äîwe shortchange our country and shortchange our future."

"We can‚Äôt afford to leave talent on the sidelines." http://t.co/wD2Bm5iA3e

Another key to strong growth that often goes overlooked &amp; undervalued: Breaking down barriers to joining the workforce‚Äîespecially for women.

"There‚Äôs no excuse not to make greater investments in cleaner, renewable energy right now."

"Bringing millions of hard-working people into the formal economy would increase our GDP by an estimated $700 billion over 10 years."

"I know it‚Äôs not always how we think about this, but another engine of strong growth should be comprehensive immigration reform."

"More growth means more jobs and more new businesses." http://t.co/Fl4eGGalIW

"Today I am proposing an agenda to raise incomes for hard-working Americans. An agenda for strong growth, fair growth, &amp; long-term growth."

"I want to see our economy work for the struggling, the striving, and the successful." http://t.co/zfZSkwCzYg

"The measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for hard-working families‚Äînot just for successful CEOs and money managers."

"As President, I will work with every possible partner to turn the tide‚Äîto make these currents of change start working for us."

"[Changes in our economy] don‚Äôt determine our destiny. The choices we make as a nation matter."

"The defining economic challenge of our time is clear: We must raise incomes for hard-working Americans." http://t.co/nt3xYtbMSd

Wages need to rise to keep up with costs. Paychecks need to grow. Families who work hard &amp; do their part deserve to get ahead &amp; stay ahead.

"I believe we have to build a 'growth and fairness' economy. You can‚Äôt have one without the other."

We can‚Äôt go back to the old policies that failed us before. http://t.co/HtNAREtpsZ

"For 35 years, Republicans have argued that if we give more wealth to those at the top...it will trickle down to everyone else."

"That bargain has eroded. Our job is to make it strong again." http://t.co/T3ARkHJRsz

"If you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead. And when you get ahead, America gets ahead."

"I‚Äôve had the opportunity to listen to Americans‚Äô concerns about an economy that still isn‚Äôt delivering for them the way it should."‚ÄîHillary
