We must have the courage to speak with moral clarity -- to call evil by its name. Watch my speech from @Heritage: https://t.co/vN9W4ZVsIH

We must use the bully pulpit of the presidency to invite others to unite against evil forces who seek to tear down freedom across the world.

We must unapologetically defend America’s interests around the globe.

We must defend Americans here in our own country.

We must stand unapologetically for freedom.

We should focus on the immediate and unambiguous challenge to our security, which is utterly destroying ISIS https://t.co/gBgnycLhyQ

In the absence of a viable alternative to Assad that isn't ISIS... https://t.co/vHE0FhXRpM

I think we should listen to our closest ally in the region, @netanyahu.

For as bad as Assad was and is, radical jihadis controlling Syria would not be an improvement.

But by the time I came to Congress in 2013, it was clear far darker forces were at work.

There's no doubt al-Assad, like his father was before him, is a bad guy who has been an ally to Iran and an enemy to the US &amp; Israel.

The intervention in Libya was, in a word, a disaster.

Today, Libya is a failed state controlled by warring terrorist networks that pose a significant threat.

We need a president who will stand up and unequivocally defend the national security interests of this country.

They came home because now a President Reagan was in the White House and the Ayatollah knew he would defend America https://t.co/TUxiir53wx

They came home not because President Carter had allowed the Islamic revolution to triumph unopposed https://t.co/TUxiir53wx

It is not an accident that the American hostages in Iran were released on January 20, 1981.

And this principle should always guide our actions. https://t.co/iFp0YlYFSu

As Reagan knew well, the best way to project America’s leadership is by protecting and promoting America’s strength.

Our third goal must be to restore America’s leadership in the world.

And it is preventing Americans from taking basic steps to protect themselves.

Loretta Lynch’s ban on what she calls anti-Muslim rhetoric is already producing its chilling effect.

In addition to protecting Americans at home, the strategy to defeat the enemy starts by calling it by it’s name: "radical Islamic terrorism"

Rather than stripping ordinary citizens of their constitutional liberties, we should have a clear strategy to utterly defeat ISIS.

The Bill of Rights is entirely compatible with protecting the safety and security of the American people.

There are some on the Right and Left who want to exploit our current crisis by calling on Americans to surrender constitutional liberties.

A safe America starts with a secure America. It is beyond time to secure our border.

What America needs is a firm resolve to always protect Americans’ freedom at home and moral clarity that starts with defining the enemy.

Whether Fort Hood, San Bernardino, or a number of others in between, President Obama’s approach has been to treat each one in isolation.

RT @HallieJackson: On heels of foreign policy-heavy intvw w/ @JoeNBC, @tedcruz reiterates natsec stance: invoking Reagan rn at Heritage htt…

Our enemy today is radical Islamic terrorism, and it can and WILL be defeated.

Today we are facing challenging times at home and abroad. What America needs today is a moment of clarity.

I tell you now, we can, and we WILL bring that back. We WILL reignite the promise of America! https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

No nation in the history of the world has allowed so many millions to come with nothing and achieve anything. https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

I was proud to help lead the fight against amnesty in the Senate in 2013: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

In 2013 we had a battle in Congress over amnesty. It was, as Ronald Reagan would have put it, “a time for choosing” https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We can and will also make the legal immigration system work better:


It is lunacy to be bringing refugees into the country who may be terrorists trying to murder Americans: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

And we will prosecute any and all companies found to be in violation of the law: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

In a Cruz Administration, I will immediately suspend the H-1B visa program for 180 days for an investigation &amp; audit https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We’ve also been stunned by report after report of companies abusing our H-1B program. These abuses will stop: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We welcome people from all over the world, but we shouldn’t welcome people defying and gaming our laws: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

It is well past time to end birthright citizenship: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We need to reform legal immigration, but it needs to be structured to serve America's needs:


We are going to help this country, and we are going to solve this problem: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

In a Cruz Administration, if municipalities are defying federal immigration law, their federal money is cut off: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

In a Cruz Administration, we will end sanctuary cities: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We are going to restore our enforcement policy and end catch and release: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

If I’m elected President, on the first day in office I'll rescind every illegal &amp; unconstitutional executive action https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We will empower state &amp; local law enforcement not as enemies, but as partners, in enforcing federal immigration law: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We will put in place a strong E-Verify system and a biometric entry/exit system on visas: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We will triple the U.S. Border Patrol: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We’re going to start with building a wall that works: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

First, we must secure the border. We’ve had both Republicans and Democrats unwilling to get the job done: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We’re tired of politicians who blow smoke. Enough talk. We’re going to solve this problem: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

There is nothing compassionate about a politician saying, “I’m so compassionate I’m willing to give away your job.”

A steady flow of illegal immigrants coming in and driving down wages impacts the wages of everyone.

Believing in the rule of law is entirely consistent with believing we a nation of immigrants.

The people being left behind are the working men &amp; women, the legal immigrants &amp; people who think the Constitution &amp; rule of law matter.

The Reagan Revolution didn't come from Washington. Washington despised Ronald Reagan. It came from millions of Americans rising up. VVS15

I will go to Congress and we will pass a simple flat tax. And when we do that, we should AbolishTheIRS! VVS15

We will finally, finally, finally secure our border and put an end to sanctuary cities! VVS15

We will rebuild our military. We will honor the commitments made to our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines! VVS15

I will instruct the Department of Education -- which should be abolished -- that Common Core ends TODAY! VVS15

I will also go to Congress and we will repeal every word of Obamacare! FullRepeal VVS15

Fifth, I will begin the process of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem -- the once and eternal capital of Israel VVS15

If you vote for me, under no circumstances will Iran be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. VVS15

The threat of a nuclear Iran is the single greatest national security threat facing America. VVS15

Fourth, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal! StopIranDeal VVS15

Third, I will instruct DOJ, IRS, and every other federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends TODAY! VVS15

The second thing I intend to do is instruct DOJ to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and these horrible videos. VVS15

The first thing I plan to do as President is rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action. VVS15

But I want to come to you with a word of hope and encouragement because the American people are waking up and help is on the way! VVS15

Every one of us know our country is in crisis. We know this isn't a typical time in politics. VVS15

I'm so honored to be back with so many friends at VVS15 today.

With your help, for once we're going to nominate a GOP candidate as committed to conservative values as Obama is committed to liberal values

When it comes to religious liberty, it is a core passion of mine that I've spent over 20 years defending.

In 2016, don't listen to campaign rhetoric. Look at each candidate's record.

I am leading the fight in the Senate against this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal

If I'm elected President, the United States will once again stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel!

The Reagan Revolution didn't come from Washington. Washington despised Ronald Reagan. MRLC

If elected, I will instruct the Department of Education -- which should be abolished -- that Common Core ends today MRLC
