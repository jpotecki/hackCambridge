I want to thank evangelical Christians for the warm embrace I've received on the campaign trail. Video: https://t.co/u6oOcWGePe

I will be in Iowa all day and until Tuesday morning. Finally, after all these years of watching stupidity, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Hillary Clinton is a major national security risk. Not presidential material!

THANK YOU to all of the incredible volunteers, behind the scenes in Iowa! CaucusForTrump https://t.co/osvIsBwAgX https://t.co/EY0wNYv9XD

"@gigglemitz: @GeraldoRivera  @FoxNews damn fox is really acting like a baby today. I guess Trump got under their skin - pretty biased!

"@classyexplorer: @oreillyfactor @DRUDGE So Bill if America was SO LONGING to learn more about candidates why the 50 percent audience loss?"

.@oreillyfactor  The people of Iowa love the fact that I stuck up for my rights, as I will do for the U.S. Also got $6,000,000 for our VETS!

.@FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night. $6,000,000 raised in one hour for our VETS.

Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse, who is easy, to endorse him. Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted!

.@BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected?  @greta

The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.

The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?

Thank you for all of your support Iowa!

It was the childishly written &amp; taunting PR statement by Fox that made me not do the debate, more so than lightweight reporter, @megynkelly.

Even though I beat him in the first six debates, especially the last one, Ted Cruz wants to debate me again. Can we do it in Canada?

Just got to listen to Rush Limbaugh - the guy is fantastic!

The statement put out yesterday by @FoxNews was a disgrace to good broadcasting and journalism. Who would ever say something so nasty &amp; dumb

I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct. Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter!

Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big. Because he was born in Canada and was, until recently, a Canadian citizen, many believe he cannot run!

Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. &amp; is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi, low interest loans. No legal disclosure &amp; never sold off assets.

Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.

Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!

The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!

.@BrentBozell, one of the National Review lightweights, came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that?

Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb --- mom can't help you with ISIS, the Chinese or with Putin.

Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll - what's going on? Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada?

Really disgusting that the failing New York Times allows dishonest writers to totally fabricate stories.

Dope Frank Bruni said I called many people, including Karl Rove, losers-true! I never called my friend @HowardStern a loser- he’s a winner!

".@TheBrodyFile Exclusive: @realDonaldTrump Says He Will Protect Evangelicals Better Than @tedcruz https://t.co/BLdnkYzMBE… CBNNews 2016"

I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem. Doubt!

Ted Cruz is falling in the polls. He is nervous. People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks!

I loved being at Liberty University today! Record setting crowd, unbelievable people! Thank you Jerry and Becki! https://t.co/YrLGb7wXyh

A great morning with everyone @LibertyU! Thank you! Off to New Hampshire now. Trump2016 


Leaving for Liberty University. I'll be speaking today in front of a record crowd. Trump2016

Just a reminder that Ted Cruz supported liberal Justice John Roberts who gave us Obamacare. https://t.co/gBnsNgomom

"@pbralick: @BenKissel great on @greggutfeld @GregGutfeldShow @JoNosuchinsky too"  Thank you Ben for your nice comments on debate!

I am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money, not controlled.  Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses.

Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday. Get tough and smart U.S., or we won't have a country anymore!

Big announcement in Ames, Iowa on Tuesday! You will not want to miss this rally! Trump2016 https://t.co/J2wyAfXdlz https://t.co/lErVfowpMX

Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from U.S., rather Airbus!

In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion, 7 most wanted and many off watch list. This will create great incentive for others!

Interesting read from Peggy Noonan. https://t.co/jAxIy8xseM

Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about &amp; demeaning? https://t.co/rYGX9vazku

Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, &amp; $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite

Departing NH now- great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth- in a snow storm! Thank you! https://t.co/m98wooUwsG https://t.co/izBMhEZolh

Greatly dishonest of @TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form &amp; not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St

When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.

Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!

If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?

Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money, does another for votes. 


Great new numbers. Thank you! 
MakeAmericaGreatAgain Trump2016


Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!

Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?

Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.

The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!

Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!

Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable

Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so

More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct.

Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher!

UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.

This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.

If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isn’t questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who can’t win.

I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate. https://t.co/DL8hDPzHoi

Strange, but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes, while he will double &amp; triple them, a disaster!

Wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few,  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!

Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries. We now are part time, sad! I WILL FIX!

The middle-class has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BAD

If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong!

"@BornToBeGOP: @realDonaldTrump We need a real President to get things done, and that's why we want you!"  Thank you.

Why are @JebBush flunkies  @ananavarro and @secupp, two of the dumbest people in politics, always on the @CNN panels..and yet Poll:Trump 39

The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!

R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!

It begins, Republican Party of Virginia, controlled by the RNC, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!

Story: https://t.co/PBOKbGIaVB https://t.co/wm9Y7E9RzB

Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!

The Phoenix V.A., it has just been reported, is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous, and people are dying. I will fix it

The same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say I won't beat Hillary.

.@chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!

@CNN just announced that TRUMP was 1 story of 2015. Totally meaningless, however, if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again!

"@deedeegop: Thank u Mr. Trump, I look forward to when u are elected next President of the United States MakeAmericaGreatAgain. So nice!

When will the Democrats, and Hillary in particular, say "we must build a wall, a great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it?" Never!

Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop, I will fix this quickly!

Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.

We have many problems in our house (country!), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!

.@deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews  She gets what is going on in politics, and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!

Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!

.@HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!

"@YesMrGilbert: @NBCNightlyNews @HallieJackson should have talked to Megyn Kelly about this story"  True, a total distortion of the facts!

I am now in Palm Beach, Florida, and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

.@meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39%, 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!

Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better!

Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!

Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly

Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!

Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3%, I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!

In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD!

Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!

Hillary, when you complain about "a penchant for sexism," who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!

It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead

Why does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump

.@FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll. All negative!

For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged," bc MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest MSM

NPR's @NealConan said "schlonged" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: "That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls." Hypocrisy

Once again, MSM is dishonest. "Schlonged" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly.

Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!

Watching @CNN and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!

Thank you, so many people have given me credit for winning the debate last night. All polls agree. It was fun and interesting!

I wonder if @megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight. No matter how well I do - bad!

.@megynkelly is very bad at math. She was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and Cruz in the new Monmouth Poll 41to14.

.@megynkelly, the most overrated anchor at @FoxNews, worked hard to explain away the new Monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead. She said 15!

Why isn't anyone using the @CNN Iowa Poll with me having a big lead. They only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place).Dishonest press

Isn't it amazing that @CNN paid a fortune for an Iowa Poll, which shows me in first place over Cruz by 13%, 33% to 20% - then doesn't use it

"@WiggintonRandy: @realDonaldTrump He will never say it, therefore he will never have a solution!"

Well, Obama refused to say (he just can't say it), that we are at WAR with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS.

Should have gone after the oil years ago (like I have been saying).

Wish Obama would say ISIS, like almost everyone else, rather than ISIL.

Is that all there is? We need a new President - FAST!

John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed, bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. A total failure!

Once John Kasich announced he was running for president, and opened his mouth, people realized he was a complete &amp; total dud!

John Kasich fell right into President Obama’s trap on ObamaCare, and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame!

Doesn’t help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else  - he’s almost last.

John Kasich ad guy wanted to work for me, but his proposal was a rip off – I said NO! Now ripping Kasich.

I loved beating John Kasich in the debates, but it was easy—he came in dead last!

Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart!

Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun!

I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don’t want to waste my money.

John Kasich, despite being Governor of Ohio, is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!

John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me.

Governor Kasich, whose failed campaign &amp; debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me.

.@CarlyFiorina had to inject herself into my factual statements concerning Ben Carson in order to breathe life into her failing campaign!

.@CarlyFiorina I only said I was on @60Minutes four weeks ago with Putin—never said I was in Green Room. Separate pieces—great ratings!

.@CarlyFiorina  Ben Carson said in his own book that he has a pathological temper &amp; pathological disease. I didn’t say it, he did. Apology?

.@CarlyFiorina Carly—I did graduate from Wharton and did very well. Who is your fact checker? Will you apologize?

.@CarlyFiorina Carly, not just you, I also told Gov. Kasich to “let Jeb talk, give him a chance” because Kasich was constantly cutting in.

"@DRUDGE_REPORT: REUTERS 5-DAY ROLLING POLL: TRUMP 34%, CARSON 19.6%, RUBIO 9.7%, CRUZ 7.7%..." Thank you - a great honor!

Wow, pres. candidate Ben Carson, who is very weak on illegal Immigration, just said  he likes amnesty and a pathway to citizenship.

.@WSJ and dopey Karl Rove made a mistake and purposely mischaracterized my statement on the terrible TPP deal.


Why does the failing @WSJ write a false editorial about me and let dummy @KarlRove make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper?

.@KarlRove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re China and TPP. This moron wasted $430 million on political campaigns and lost 100%

We, as a country, either have borders or we don't. IF WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!

Why wouldn't the @WSJ call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong. No wonder it is doing poorly!

When and how are the dummies at the @WSJ going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me. I want "smart" trade deals.

The @WSJ Editorial Board is so wrong, so often. They got info from an incorrect story in another pub. Why not watch and listen to debate.

.@WSJ Editorial Board should review my debate statement re China and T.P.P. and apologize. China not part but will get their way in later.

Today's @WSJ Editorial is WRONG again. I know that China is not in the new T.P.P. trade deal but would come in latter through a back door.

Carson now admits his friend named "Bob," who he tried to stab (Bob was saved by his belt buckle!), no longer exists as Bob. Wrong name!

With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer, stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it?

Such bad reporting: A puff piece on Ben Carson in the @nytimes states that Carson "is trying to solidify his lead." But I am 1, easily! Sad

While in politics it is often smart to send out false messages, one thing is clear:  That Hillary does not want to run against TRUMP.

Join me Tuesday Nov. 3rd at 12 PM in TrumpTower in NYC. I'll be signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don't miss it!

If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered!

Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a "lightweight".

I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor!

Jeb's new slogan - "Jeb can fix it". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word "fix" is not a good one to use in politics!

Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio  READ THIS: https://t.co/Tj85IsBPG8"

Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win

Carly Fiorina did such a horrible job at Lucent and HP, virtually destroying both companies, that she never got another CEO job offer! Pres.

We are going to WIN and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, maybe better than ever before!

I am attracting the biggest crowds, by far, and the best poll numbers, also by far.   Much of the media is totally dishonest. So sad!

I have been leading big in all  polls, with two more today, @nbc and @CNN. The NBC poll is more than double next,  at 29%. Fiorina has 11%.

There is no way that Carly  Fiorina can become the Republican Nominee or win against the Dems. Boxer killed her for Senate in California!

I will be on @meetthepress at 10:30. @nbc will be releasing their new poll numbers. Based on the debate results, I should do well-who knows?

If I would have challenged the man, the media would have accused me of interfering with that man's right of free speech. A no win situation!

If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president, do you really think he would come to my rescue? No chance!

This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something.

Three out of the four largest financial institutions are bigger now than before we bailed them out.

Kids are jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes. Nothing happens to Wall Street execs whose illegal behavior harmed millions.

And within one year, my administration will break these institutions up so that they no longer pose a grave threat to the economy.

During the first 100 days of my administration, the Treasury Department will create a too-big-to fail list of banks and insurance companies.

But we have something they don’t have: millions of working families standing together demanding fundamental changes in our financial system.

Yes, Wall Street makes huge campaign contributions and they provide very generous speaking fees to those who go before them. BreakEmUp

Yes @ChrisChristie. George W. Bush — gave us Iraq war, Wall St crash — was one of our great presidents. You are right. DebateWithBernie

Just what we need. More neocon policies to continue the Bush legacy. DebateWithBernie

Yup. Bush was a great president. Yes. No doubt. Great president. All Obama's fault. DebateWithBernie

Okay. Let's vote for Reagan. Sounds better than any of these guys. DebateWithBernie GOPDebate

Rich get richer. Median fmly income $5k less than in 1999. One of the highest rates of childhood poverty. Any discussion? DebateWithBernie

Rich get richer. Everyone else gets poorer. And all these guys can talk about is war and defunding Planned Parenthood. DebateWithBernie

Still waiting. Will they ever talk about climate change as a foreign policy issue? Or talk about it all? DebateWithBernie

Gee. How come these guys are not talking about the great "success" of Bush's foreign policy and the war in Iraq? DebateWithBernie

Trump. What a pleasant and humble person. Can't stop saying kind and generous things about his fellow Republicans. DebateWithBernie

30mil Americans have no health insurance. Even more underinsured. And Trump wants to get rid of Obamacare. Really? DebateWithBernie

We must have the courage to speak with moral clarity -- to call evil by its name. Watch my speech from @Heritage: https://t.co/vN9W4ZVsIH

We must use the bully pulpit of the presidency to invite others to unite against evil forces who seek to tear down freedom across the world.

We must unapologetically defend America’s interests around the globe.

We must defend Americans here in our own country.

We must stand unapologetically for freedom.

We should focus on the immediate and unambiguous challenge to our security, which is utterly destroying ISIS https://t.co/gBgnycLhyQ

In the absence of a viable alternative to Assad that isn't ISIS... https://t.co/vHE0FhXRpM

I think we should listen to our closest ally in the region, @netanyahu.

For as bad as Assad was and is, radical jihadis controlling Syria would not be an improvement.

But by the time I came to Congress in 2013, it was clear far darker forces were at work.

There's no doubt al-Assad, like his father was before him, is a bad guy who has been an ally to Iran and an enemy to the US &amp; Israel.

The intervention in Libya was, in a word, a disaster.

Today, Libya is a failed state controlled by warring terrorist networks that pose a significant threat.

We need a president who will stand up and unequivocally defend the national security interests of this country.

They came home because now a President Reagan was in the White House and the Ayatollah knew he would defend America https://t.co/TUxiir53wx

They came home not because President Carter had allowed the Islamic revolution to triumph unopposed https://t.co/TUxiir53wx

It is not an accident that the American hostages in Iran were released on January 20, 1981.

And this principle should always guide our actions. https://t.co/iFp0YlYFSu

As Reagan knew well, the best way to project America’s leadership is by protecting and promoting America’s strength.

Our third goal must be to restore America’s leadership in the world.

And it is preventing Americans from taking basic steps to protect themselves.

Loretta Lynch’s ban on what she calls anti-Muslim rhetoric is already producing its chilling effect.

In addition to protecting Americans at home, the strategy to defeat the enemy starts by calling it by it’s name: "radical Islamic terrorism"

Rather than stripping ordinary citizens of their constitutional liberties, we should have a clear strategy to utterly defeat ISIS.

The Bill of Rights is entirely compatible with protecting the safety and security of the American people.

There are some on the Right and Left who want to exploit our current crisis by calling on Americans to surrender constitutional liberties.

A safe America starts with a secure America. It is beyond time to secure our border.

What America needs is a firm resolve to always protect Americans’ freedom at home and moral clarity that starts with defining the enemy.

Whether Fort Hood, San Bernardino, or a number of others in between, President Obama’s approach has been to treat each one in isolation.

RT @HallieJackson: On heels of foreign policy-heavy intvw w/ @JoeNBC, @tedcruz reiterates natsec stance: invoking Reagan rn at Heritage htt…

Our enemy today is radical Islamic terrorism, and it can and WILL be defeated.

In a Cruz Admin, it would be clear to any militant that if you go and join ISIS, you're signing your death warrant.


We must make it clear that affiliation w/ ISIS &amp; related terrorist groups brings w/ it the undying enmity of America https://t.co/oM9GFyPift

America must stand with our allies against the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism: https://t.co/oM9GFyPift

Our deepest condolences go out to our French allies. I know the the US stands by to offer any assistance necessary: https://t.co/oM9GFyPift

Horrific reports coming out of Paris. Our thoughts and prayers are with all the people of France — our oldest ally. https://t.co/701TBDfwQB

RT @TeamTedCruz: Add your name to support @tedcruz's new plan to stop illegal immigration! https://t.co/IRkIJA45pO https://t.co/v5AgKQVFfI

I tell you now, we can, and we WILL bring that back. We WILL reignite the promise of America! https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

No nation in the history of the world has allowed so many millions to come with nothing and achieve anything. https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

I was proud to help lead the fight against amnesty in the Senate in 2013: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

In 2013 we had a battle in Congress over amnesty. It was, as Ronald Reagan would have put it, “a time for choosing” https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We can and will also make the legal immigration system work better:


It is lunacy to be bringing refugees into the country who may be terrorists trying to murder Americans: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

And we will prosecute any and all companies found to be in violation of the law: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

In a Cruz Administration, I will immediately suspend the H-1B visa program for 180 days for an investigation &amp; audit https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We’ve also been stunned by report after report of companies abusing our H-1B program. These abuses will stop: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We welcome people from all over the world, but we shouldn’t welcome people defying and gaming our laws: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

It is well past time to end birthright citizenship: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We need to reform legal immigration, but it needs to be structured to serve America's needs:


We are going to help this country, and we are going to solve this problem: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

In a Cruz Administration, if municipalities are defying federal immigration law, their federal money is cut off: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

In a Cruz Administration, we will end sanctuary cities: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We are going to restore our enforcement policy and end catch and release: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

If I’m elected President, on the first day in office I'll rescind every illegal &amp; unconstitutional executive action https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We will empower state &amp; local law enforcement not as enemies, but as partners, in enforcing federal immigration law: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We will put in place a strong E-Verify system and a biometric entry/exit system on visas: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We will triple the U.S. Border Patrol: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We’re going to start with building a wall that works: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

First, we must secure the border. We’ve had both Republicans and Democrats unwilling to get the job done: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

We’re tired of politicians who blow smoke. Enough talk. We’re going to solve this problem: https://t.co/JxWTrzbDLd

There is nothing compassionate about a politician saying, “I’m so compassionate I’m willing to give away your job.”

A steady flow of illegal immigrants coming in and driving down wages impacts the wages of everyone.

Believing in the rule of law is entirely consistent with believing we a nation of immigrants.

The people being left behind are the working men &amp; women, the legal immigrants &amp; people who think the Constitution &amp; rule of law matter.

The WashingtonCartel is in complete agreement over amnesty.

In Washington there is an unholy alliance between K Street and Wall Street. You have the WashingtonCartel.

If we continue to stand together, we can bring back that Shining City on a Hill that is the United States of America! SunshineSummit

What ties us all together as Americans is we are all the children of people who risked everything for freedom. SunshineSummit

But if you think Washington is broken and we need to get power back to the people — THAT is what this campaign is all about. SunshineSummit

If you think things in Washington are going great, then I ain’t your guy. SunshineSummit

If you see a candidate that Washington embraces, run and hide! SunshineSummit

I’ll go to Congress and we will pass a Simple Flat Tax — 10% for every American. And then we should AbolishTheIRS! SunshineSummit

We will finally, finally, finally secure the border and end sanctuary cities. SunshineSummit

I’ll instruct the Department of Education — which should be abolished — that Common Core ends today! SunshineSummit

I’ll go to Congress and we will repeal every word of Obamacare. SunshineSummit

And with me, when I tell you I’m going to do something, you know I’ll do exactly what I said I’ll do. SunshineSummit

I'll make clear that under no circumstances will Iran be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. SunshineSummit

As President, I’ll rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal! SunshineSummit

The Reagan Revolution didn't come from Washington. Washington despised Ronald Reagan. It came from millions of Americans rising up. VVS15

I will go to Congress and we will pass a simple flat tax. And when we do that, we should AbolishTheIRS! VVS15

We will finally, finally, finally secure our border and put an end to sanctuary cities! VVS15

We will rebuild our military. We will honor the commitments made to our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines! VVS15

I will instruct the Department of Education -- which should be abolished -- that Common Core ends TODAY! VVS15

I will also go to Congress and we will repeal every word of Obamacare! FullRepeal VVS15

Fifth, I will begin the process of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem -- the once and eternal capital of Israel VVS15

If you vote for me, under no circumstances will Iran be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. VVS15

The threat of a nuclear Iran is the single greatest national security threat facing America. VVS15

Fourth, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal! StopIranDeal VVS15

Third, I will instruct DOJ, IRS, and every other federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends TODAY! VVS15

The second thing I intend to do is instruct DOJ to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and these horrible videos. VVS15

The first thing I plan to do as President is rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action. VVS15

But I want to come to you with a word of hope and encouragement because the American people are waking up and help is on the way! VVS15

Every one of us know our country is in crisis. We know this isn't a typical time in politics. VVS15

I'm so honored to be back with so many friends at VVS15 today.

With your help, for once we're going to nominate a GOP candidate as committed to conservative values as Obama is committed to liberal values

When it comes to religious liberty, it is a core passion of mine that I've spent over 20 years defending.

In 2016, don't listen to campaign rhetoric. Look at each candidate's record.

I am leading the fight in the Senate against this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal

If I'm elected President, the United States will once again stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel!

The biggest difference between me and the other candidates is when I say I'm going to do something, that's exactly what I'm going to do

On my first day as President we will begin to move our embassy in Israel to Jerusalem

I was particularly honored to receive the endorsement of @gunowners of America for our presidential campaign

It came from the American people and it turned this nation around. I'm optimistic because the same thing is happening again. MRLC

The Reagan Revolution didn't come from Washington. Washington despised Ronald Reagan. MRLC

I will go to Congress and we will pass fundamental tax reform. We will pass a simple flat tax. And then we should AbolishTheIRS! MRLC

If elected, I will instruct the Department of Education -- which should be abolished -- that Common Core ends today MRLC

We will repeal every word of Obamacare MRLC

To truly honor those lost at Benghazi, we need to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the brave Americans who do their work.

America must do all we can to protect our personnel doing the important work of representing our interests and values around the world.

The work of Chris Stevens and his colleagues represented the best of this approach to foreign policy.

America must pursue a smart brand of leadership that integrates and balances the tools of diplomacy, development, and defense.

We cannot return to the go-it-alone foreign policy of the past, where military-based solutions are pursued as a first option.

American diplomats cannot conduct their work from bunkers. Advancing US interests often means going to unstable regions.

Hillary is testifying before @HouseBenghazi to defend the vision of US diplomacy that Ambassador Stevens gave his life carrying out.

America must continue to lead in a dangerous world. To do otherwise would mean drawing the wrong lesson from the Benghazi tragedy.

A lesson from Benghazi: Congress needs to do its part to ensure that our diplomats in dangerous parts of the world are as safe as possible.

Our prisons—where 2/3 inmates meet criteria for substance use disorders—are no substitute for treatment. We must reform our justice system.

Our health care system allows too many people with substance use disorders to go without care. We need to invest in treatment.

23 million Americans suffer from addiction, but only 1 in 10 get the treatment they need. http://t.co/xEy7aZjMTK

Drug and alcohol addiction is a disease, not a moral failing—and we must treat it as such.

Leadership is about strength, smart choices, and an unyielding commitment to America’s values.

Today on the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Adam, Dale &amp; I are thrilled to spend the day with Hillary. ADA25

We know Hillary’s a fighter &amp; that she’ll fight for Adam as President just like she did at the Children’s Defense Fund &amp; in Congress.

Iowa's @SenatorHarkin co-authored the ADA. We're proud to have been represented by such a strong champion for people with disabilities.

Later that night, she joined us to talk about the big questions that really need to be asked—for Adam, and for everyone fighting for a cure.

"What do we have here?" she asked. Adam's father came over, thanking Hillary for her commitment to epilepsy research with a hug.

I’ll never forget the first time Adam met Hillary. At a dinner in 2007, Adam broke away from us &amp; ran up to her.

Adam's teacher said, "We’ll make it happen—that's our job." The rest is history. He has loved, loved it.

She told me that he was a great runner! I just thought, "How would this happen?" I knew it should happen, but I also knew the challenges.

We’re grateful for supportive teachers. In junior high, his PE teacher called &amp; asked if Adam would go for cross country.

For Adam, that means enjoying cross country. At meets, other teams run him in &amp; congratulate him. It's neat to see! http://t.co/YGk4krihuz

Through Adam, we informally raise awareness for people with disabilities every day: It's as simple as taking pride in the small things.

We’ll rely on organizations in our community, because Adam will need training, direction &amp; safety as an adult.

One thing that concerns us as Adam gets older is what happens after he finishes school.

The ADA ensures Adam &amp; Turbo are welcome everywhere. Turbo even joined us at Wrigley Field for a @Cubs game! http://t.co/msnZm7FcRg

Adam’s service dog Turbo is a huge part of our lives. He goes everywhere with Adam, including school.

He’s always doing that. http://t.co/dQKmLOtkCw

During the school year, Adam's a member of the cross country team. I never imagined he'd be a runner like me &amp; Dale, but he proved us wrong.

His father Dale &amp; I work, so Adam spends summer days at @TheArcUS. Yesterday we celebrated ADA Night at @CRKernels! http://t.co/n8ysuMoseC

My son Adam has Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, a form of epilepsy. The ADA helps him to live life to the fullest, each &amp; every day. ADA25

Let's build an economy that works for everyone. Join Hillary: http://t.co/nW2JqXGZT9 http://t.co/qDSTlIljsJ

"I’m running for President to build an America for tomorrow, not yesterday—where if you do your part, you will reap the rewards."—Hillary

"Above all, we have to break out of the poisonous partisan gridlock and focus on the long-term needs of our country."

"Let's get back to making decisions that rely on evidence more than ideology."

"I will appoint and empower regulators who understand that Too Big To Fail is still too big a problem."

"I will offer plans to rein in excessive risk on Wall Street and ensure that stock markets work for everyday investors."

"Too often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences...This is wrong—&amp; on my watch, it will change."

Hillary on misconduct in the financial industry: "There can be no justification or tolerance for this kind of criminal behavior."

"Workers are assets. Investing in them pays off. Higher wages pay off. And training pays off."

"Too many pressures in our economy today are pushing us toward short-termism." http://t.co/AgJQAOjBB9

"The third key driver of income gains alongside strong growth and fair growth must be long-term growth." http://t.co/3wz5pKFic7

"When all Americans have the chance to study hard, work hard, and share in our country’s prosperity—that’s fair growth."

"To create fair growth, we need to create opportunity for more Americans." http://t.co/zt177GbuwG

"If we want to get serious about raising incomes, we have to get serious about supporting union workers."

"I will propose ways to encourage companies to share profits with their employees. That's good for workers, and good for businesses."

"To get all incomes rising again, we need to strike a better balance. If you work hard, you ought to be paid fairly."

"Let him tell that to the fast food workers marching in the streets for better pay.

They don’t need a lecture—they need a raise."

"You may have heard Gov. Bush say last week that Americans just need to work longer hours. He must not have met very many American workers."

"The evidence is in: Inequality is a drag on our entire economy. This is the problem we need to tackle." http://t.co/Q6Bbhwbtb6

"As President, I’ll fight to put families first—just like I have my entire career."

"For far too long, these challenges have been dismissed by some as 'women’s issues.' Well, those days are over."

"It’s way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job—and women of color making even less."

"It’s time to recognize that quality, affordable child care is not a luxury—it’s a growth strategy."

"When we leave people out, or write them off, we not only shortchange them—we shortchange our country and shortchange our future."

"We can’t afford to leave talent on the sidelines." http://t.co/wD2Bm5iA3e

Another key to strong growth that often goes overlooked &amp; undervalued: Breaking down barriers to joining the workforce—especially for women.

"There’s no excuse not to make greater investments in cleaner, renewable energy right now."

"Bringing millions of hard-working people into the formal economy would increase our GDP by an estimated $700 billion over 10 years."

"I know it’s not always how we think about this, but another engine of strong growth should be comprehensive immigration reform."

"More growth means more jobs and more new businesses." http://t.co/Fl4eGGalIW

"Today I am proposing an agenda to raise incomes for hard-working Americans. An agenda for strong growth, fair growth, &amp; long-term growth."

"I want to see our economy work for the struggling, the striving, and the successful." http://t.co/zfZSkwCzYg

"The measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for hard-working families—not just for successful CEOs and money managers."

"As President, I will work with every possible partner to turn the tide—to make these currents of change start working for us."

"[Changes in our economy] don’t determine our destiny. The choices we make as a nation matter."

"The defining economic challenge of our time is clear: We must raise incomes for hard-working Americans." http://t.co/nt3xYtbMSd

Wages need to rise to keep up with costs. Paychecks need to grow. Families who work hard &amp; do their part deserve to get ahead &amp; stay ahead.

"I believe we have to build a 'growth and fairness' economy. You can’t have one without the other."

We can’t go back to the old policies that failed us before. http://t.co/HtNAREtpsZ

"For 35 years, Republicans have argued that if we give more wealth to those at the top...it will trickle down to everyone else."

"That bargain has eroded. Our job is to make it strong again." http://t.co/T3ARkHJRsz

"If you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead. And when you get ahead, America gets ahead."

"I’ve had the opportunity to listen to Americans’ concerns about an economy that still isn’t delivering for them the way it should."—Hillary

Let's build this together. http://t.co/vibvcipflC

"She was born on June 4, 1919—before women in America had the right to vote. But on that very day..." http://t.co/yVYlugvSor

A lesson from Hillary's mom: "Life's not about what happens to you. It's about what you do with what happens to you—so get back out there."



Advantage, Hillary. http://t.co/vewNE5SvMP

Texts from Hillary start today. Text "2016" to 47246 to get texts from the campaign. Hillary2016 http://t.co/F42WbjDlIb

"I want you to join me in this effort. Help me build this campaign and make it your own."

How could Hillary and President Obama work together after a tough campaign? Simple. http://t.co/tpBIN9N6qv

Hillary will fight to make it easier to vote—not harder. http://t.co/ZZDBNDzqnu

"To be strong in the world, we first have to be strong at home … The fourth fight: reforming our government and revitalizing our democracy."

Our third fight: "to harness all of America's power, smarts, and values to maintain our leadership for peace, security, and prosperity."

RT if you agree. http://t.co/KxIzeGHR1T



"In America, every family should feel like they belong." http://t.co/oNFWjgLTay

There's no better word for this than the one Hillary just used: "Outrage." http://t.co/ZxKgfQiSVz

No one should have to choose between keeping a paycheck and caring for a loved one. http://t.co/033QTUuqAK

This is wrong. http://t.co/HmNEH2TGQH

"The second fight is to strengthen America's families, because when our families are strong, America is strong."

"Let's make college affordable and available to all...and lift the crushing burden of student debt."

"I will propose that we make preschool and quality childcare available to every child in America."

"Building an economy for tomorrow also requires investing in our most important asset: our people—beginning with our youngest."

"Investing in clean energy will:
✔️ Create millions of jobs
✔️ Let us lead the global fight against climate change" http://t.co/BZbzFhpTF2

When small businesses are strong, our economy is strong. http://t.co/KXQVUOBign

Hillary wants to be the small-business president. Here's what that means: http://t.co/iRackYTo78

Hillary's first fight: "make the economy work for everyday Americans, not just those at the top."

"I want to wage and win Four Fights for you." Click to learn more. http://t.co/JQpqsVEspz

Why is Hillary running for president? To be a champion for people like Bethany: http://t.co/I7M6O6rD4E

"My mother taught me that everybody needs a chance and a champion. She knew what it was like not to have either one." http://t.co/YCI5bKYSLA



My values and a lifetime of experiences have given me a different vision for America.

"They turn their backs on gay people who love each other." http://t.co/3zWcib9lpH

"They want to put immigrants who work hard and pay taxes at risk of deportation." http://t.co/i6OMOZvaIh

"They shame and blame women rather than respect our right to make our own reproductive health decisions." http://t.co/VpGcYpyg7F

If the candidates who deny climate change aren't scientists, why don't they start listening to those who are? http://t.co/QqCIO7WLJX

"There may be some new voices in the Republican presidential choir, but they're all singing the same old song. A song called 'Yesterday.'"

We can't harness change and solve problems if we go back to the top-down economic policies that failed us before. http://t.co/DgopqO6bMp



It's your time. http://t.co/gfAnewbn1B

What's wrong with this picture? http://t.co/GnytNmNS7A

"You figured out how to make it work. And now people are beginning to think about the future again." http://t.co/Y2O0eVp4Yh

"We’re still working our way back from a crisis that happened because time-tested values were replaced by false promises."

"If you do your part you ought to be able to get ahead—and when everybody does their part, America gets ahead too." http://t.co/mP5wZAmJjL

President Roosevelt said "there's no mystery about what it takes to build a strong and prosperous America": http://t.co/JDse6Ute4s

"Today we refuse...to allow our country and this generation of leaders to slow or reverse America’s long march toward a more perfect union."

"We need a Supreme Court who cares more about the right to vote of a person than the right to buy an election of a corporation."

"All of these reforms...are commonsense ways to strengthen our democracy, but none of them will come easily. It’s going to take leadership."

"If you're an eligible voter and want to be registered, you should be a registered voter—period."

RT if you agree: We should make it as easy as possible for every American citizen to make their voice heard. http://t.co/waRraQNdpS

Hillary calls for automatic voter registration—for everybody. http://t.co/AWMYuaDJLB

"Early in-person voting will reduce those long lines and give more citizens the chance to participate."

"We should set a standard across our country of at least 20 days of early in-person voting everywhere."

"We should implement...commonsense reforms, including expanding early, absentee, and mail voting."

"Congress should move quickly...to repair [damage to Voting Rights Act] &amp; restore the full protections that American voters need &amp; deserve."
